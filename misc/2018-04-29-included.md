This year I went to Barcelona for work. I arrived the day before my meetings started, so I had a little bit of time for sight seeing. One of the first things I did was to get some lunch. I had been studying Spanish for about a month, so the obvious thing to do was to order my food in Spanish. So when the waiter came by, I said “agua por favor.” He responded with “¿frío o temperatura ambiente?” My blank stare gave away that I had no idea what he’d just said. 

Fortunately the waiter’s English was better than my Spanish. And, the restaurant’s menu was translated from Spanish into at least eight languages, including English. By translating the menu, the folks at the restaurant are saying that people from every nation are welcome.

To understand how welcoming it was, imagine what it would have been like if the menu had only been in Spanish, or in the local language, Catalán.

This is but one example of the things we do to try to make people feel welcome. We reach out of our comfort zone so that others can be included.

At the communion table, we are invited to join Jesus in a meal. His normal, comfortable environment surely isn’t our world. But he gave up his divine privileges. He took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being. He makes room for us at his table.

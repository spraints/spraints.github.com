  This is the web site of Matt Burke.
  I work at <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a>.
  My wife and I run <a href="http://burkefarm.wordpress.com/">the farming engineers</a>,
  a small, certified USDA Organic vegetable farm in central Indiana.
</p>

<p>
  This site is the home of my <a href="/blog/">blog</a>.
  Feel free to check out some of my <a href="/projects">open-source projects</a>, as well.

<h4>Of historical note...</h4>

<p>
  I formerly blogged at <a href="http://mattonrails.wordpress.com/">matt on rails</a>. I intend
  to move those posts over, but you know how that goes. :)

<p>
  This site was formerly a "newspaper" for the small town near my home. That site is still
  running at <a href="http://news.pickardayune.com/">news.pickardayune.com</a>.
